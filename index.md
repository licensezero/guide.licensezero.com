# License Zero Maintainer's Guide

License Zero is a game plan for financially sustaining independent work on open software.  License Zero lets you make a new deal with users of software you maintain:

> Use my software freely for open source or noncommercial work, but otherwise buy a license online to support me.

It's the model of [GitHub](https://github.com/pricing), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/plans), and other leading developer services, adapted for independent library, framework, and tools developers.  Finally.

This is a guide to License Zero, the project's primary documentation for maintainers.  If you're interested in using License Zero for your work, read this guide.  If you find errors or ways to improve it, send a [pull request](https://github.com/licensezero/licensezero-guide).

This guide describes what License Zero is, and how it works.  It is _not_ a substitute for legal advice about whether that system is right for you or your work.  licensezero.com's [terms of service](https://licensezero.com/terms/service) apply to this guide, too.

As an independent software developer, you control who can use your software, and under what terms.  License Zero licenses give everyone broad permission to use and build with your software, as long as they limit commercial use or share work they build on yours back as open source, depending on the public license terms you choose.  Users who can't meet those conditions need private licenses to use your software.

[licensezero.com](https://licensezero.com) sells those users separate, private licenses, on your behalf.  A [command line interface](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/licensezero) makes it easy for users to buy all the private licenses they need for a Node.js project at once, with a single credit card transaction.  [Stripe](https://stripe.com) processes payments directly to an account in your name.  The same tool makes it easy for you to sign up, start offering new projects, and set pricing.

This "dual licensing" model is not new.  [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/oem/) pioneered it decades ago, and important projects like [Qt](https://www1.qt.io/licensing/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/community/licensing) continue it, successfully, today.  License Zero evolves the dual licensing model by making it useful for more kinds of software and practical for independent developers who can't or don't want to set up companies to handle the mechanics of private licensing.


## <a id="public-licenses">Public Licenses</a>

License Zero starts where you exercise your power as the owner of intellectual property in your work: in your project's `LICENSE` file.  You might currently use [The MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT), [a BSD license](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause), or a similar open source license there now.  License Zero offers you two alternatives:

1.  [The License Zero Noncommercial Public License (L0&#x2011;NC)](https://licensezero.com/licenses/noncommercial) gives everyone broad permission to use your software, but limits commercial use to a short trial period of seven days.  When a commercial user's trial runs out, they need to buy a private license or stop using your software.  L0&#x2011;NC works a bit like a [Creative Commons NonCommercial license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), but for software.

2.  [The License Zero Reciprocal Public License (L0&#x2011;R)](https://licensezero.com/licenses/reciprocal) requires users who change, build on, or use your work to create software to release that software as open source, too.  If users can't or won't release their work, they need to buy a private license that allows use without sharing back.  L0&#x2011;R works a bit like [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html), but requires users to release more of their own code, in more situations.

Both L0 public licenses are short and readable.  You should [read](https://licensezero.com/licenses/noncommercial) [them](https://licensezero.com/licenses/reciprocal).


### <a id="comparing-public-licenses">Comparing Public Licenses</a>

The two License Zero public licenses aren't just worded differently.  They achieve different results.  Abstracting them a bit:

```python
def noncommercial_license:
  if commercial_user:
    if within_trial_period:
      return 'free to use'
    else:
      return 'need to buy a private license'
  else:
    return 'free to use'

def reciprocal_license:
  if building_software:
    if release_software_as_open_source:
      return 'free to use'
    else:
      return 'need to buy a private license'
  else:
    return 'free to use'
```

Consider a few user scenarios, and how they play out under different License Zero public licenses:

1.  A for-profit company wants to use a License Zero library in their closed-source, proprietary web app.  They will _not_ release their web app as open source.

    - If the library is licensed under L0&#x2011;NC, the company can only use the library for seven days under its public license.  Then they need to buy a private license.

    - If the library is licensed under L0&#x2011;R, the company needs to buy a private license to use the library in their web app at all.  They can't use the library under its public license, because they won't meet the condition of releasing their web app as open source.

2.  A for-profit company wants to use a License Zero library in the data synchronization software they ship with voice recorders.  They plan to release the sync software as open source.

    - If the library is licensed under L0&#x2011;NC, the company can only use the library for seven days under the public license.  Then they need to buy a private license.  Moreover, any company customer can only use the library as part of the sync software for commercial commercial purposes under the public license for seven days.  Then they need to buy a private license, too.

    - If the library is licensed under L0&#x2011;R, the company can use the library in their sync software under the public license, as long as they actually release the sync software as open source.  The company's customers can use the sync software, with the library, for any purpose.

3.  A for-profit company wants to use a License Zero video player application to show commercials in their office lobby.

    - If the application is licensed under L0&#x2011;NC, the company can only use the application for seven days under the public license.  Then they need to buy a private license.

    - If the application is licensed under L0&#x2011;R, the company is free to use the application for as long as they like under the public license.

L0&#x2011;NC allows users to build and use closed and proprietary software with your work, as long they use it for noncommercial purposes.  L0&#x2011;R allows users to build and use only open source software with your work, even for very profit-driven purposes.  Many noncommercial software users are happy to make their work open source, but many make closed software, too.  Many for-profit companies make closed software, but many also make and release open source software, too.

License Zero was inspired by imbalances in the relationship between open source developers and users.  Both License Zero public licenses represent new deals between developers and users, designed to redress that imbalance.  It isn't clear yet which public license approach is best, either overall or for any particular kind of software.  Before you pick a public license, make a few notes about how you think users will use and build on your software.  Then think about how they will play out under L0&#x2011;NC, and then again under L0&#x2011;R.


### <a id="license-politics">License Politics</a>

The public licenses also differ in some meaningful political ways you should be aware of.

L0&#x2011;NC is not an "open source" or "free software" license as many community members define those terms, because it discriminates against commercial use.  Source for L0&#x2011;NC can still be published and developed online, using many popular services like [GitHub](https://github.com) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).  But many in those communities will not accept it as part of their movements, and perhaps criticize you for referring to it as "open source" or "free software".

L0&#x2011;R, on the other hand, was written to conform to the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd), and proposed to the [Open Source Initiative's license-review mailing list](https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/) for approval in September of 2017.  Approval has been controversial, in part because L0&#x2011;R goes further than existing licenses in when and what code it requires be released as open source.  It's our position that L0&#x2011;R conforms to the Open Source Definition as written, resembles licenses that OSI has approved in the past, and software under L0&#x2011;R is therefore open source software.

L0&#x2011;R is probably not a "free software" license [as defined by the Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).  FSF's definition of free software requires granting freedoms to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software.  But it also recognizes that some conditions on those freedoms can enhance software freedom overall by ensuring that others receive source code and freedom to work with it.  However, FSF's definition of free software admits only conditions on the freedom to share modified versions with others, not other freedoms.  That partially explains why the Open Source Initiative [approved RPL&#x2011;1.5](https://opensource.org/licenses/RPL-1.5), a thematic predecessor of L0&#x2011;, while FSF [considers RPL non-free](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#RPL).

In the end, your software is yours to license.  These politics may or may not matter to you, and they may or may not matter to your users or potential users.


## <a id="private-licenses">Private Licenses</a>

Users who can't meet the conditions of the License Zero public license you choose for your project can buy a private license that allows them to use your work without meeting the public license's demanding conditions.

License Zero publishes a [form private license](https://licensezero.com/licenses/private).  The private license is based on [The Apache License, Version 2.0](https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), a well known, enterprise-friendly open source license, with changes that transform it into a private, proprietary license.

The private license comes in four variants:

1.  solo tier, for a single person
2.  team tier, for up to 10 people
2.  company tier, for up to 100 people
3.  enterprise tier, for an unlimited number of people

Each private license grants the buyer broad permission under copyright and patent law to use the software.  Team-tier, company-tier, and enterprise-tier private licenses also allow the buyer to extend, or sublicense, that permission to their employees and independent contractors.  Team-tier and company-tier private licenses limit the number of people the buyer can sublicense in any rolling one-year period.  Enterprise-tier private licenses don't impose an limit.

Note that the private license terms do _not_ allow buyers to sublicense their customers, or others who want to use software they build on top of your work.  Those users will need to abide by the terms of your public license, or purchase private licenses for themselves.  [Relicensing](#relicensing), covered below, might be an attractive option for those who want to build on your software as if it were permissively licensed.

Private licenses last forever, and cover all work that you release under the same [project identifier](#identifiers).  But you don't promise to do any new work, or make it available under the same project identifier, by selling private licenses.


## <a id="waivers">Waivers</a>

Waivers work a bit like freebie private licenses.  As a maintainer, you can use the [command line interface](#command-line-interface) to generate signed [waivers](https://licensezero.com/licenses/waiver) for specific people and companies that you want to let out of your public license's conditions limiting commercial use or require release as open source.  You can generate waivers that last only a set number of days, or that last forever.  The [command line interface](#command-line-interface) treats waivers just like private licenses for purposes of calculating what additional licenses a users needs for their project.

You might like to issue waivers to reward contributors to your project who make their work available under a permissive license, for [parallel licensing](#parallel-licensing), extend the free trial period for projects under L&#x2011;NC terms, or to resolve a question about whether a particular use will trigger the commercial-use time limit. 

## <a id="relicensing">Relicensing</a>

License Zero allows, but does not require, setting a price at which you agree to change the public license terms for your contributions to a project to those of [The License Zero Permissive Public License (L0&#x2011;P)](https://licensezero.com/licenses/permissive).  This is called "relicensing".


### <a id="permissive-license">Permissive License</a>

[L0&#x2011;P](https://licensezero.com/licenses/permissive) is a highly permissive open source software license, much like [The MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT) and [the two-clause BSD license](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause), but easier to read and more legally complete.  It gives everyone who receives a copy of your software permission under copyright and patent law to work with and built on it in any way they like, as long as they preserve your license information in copies they give to others and refrain from suing users of your project for violating patents on it.

Relicensing your project under L0&#x2011;P removes any reason for users to purchase private licenses for your project.  Under the [agency terms](https://licensezero.com/terms/agency) you must agree to in order to offer private licenses for a project through License Zero, you must retract your project for sale through the API if you relicense it.


### <a id="relicense-agreement">Relicense Agreement</a>

The [relicense agreement](https://licensezero.com/licenses/relicense) sets out the terms of agreement between you and the sponsor who pays the relicense price you set.  When a customer pays the price, [Artless Devices](#artless-devices) signs the relicense agreement with the sponsor on your behalf, as your agent.

As the developer, your obligations are set out in the "Relicensing" section of the agreement.  Once you receive payment, you're obligated to take the steps listed there.


## <a id="licensezero.com">licensezero.com</a>

licensezero.com is a website and API for selling [private licenses](#private-licenses), closing [relicense deals](#relicensing), and generating [waivers](#waivers).

You can think of licensezero.com as a kind of Internet vending machine.  As a maintainer, you can make a deal with the operator of the vending machine to stock it with private licenses and relicense deals for sale.  The vending machine then handles taking payment and issuing licenses on your behalf.

You could also think of licensezero.com as a kind of e-commerce platform service-izing the back-office operations of a dual licensing business:negotiation, communication, payment processing, records management.  Rather than start a company and hire to handle those tasks, or take time away from development to do them yourself, you can use licensezero.com to run your licensing business.  It works just a well for expensive licenses priced in the thousands of dollars and relatively cheap licenses costing just a few bucks.


### <a id="stripe-connect">Stripe Connect</a>

You can create an account to sell private licenses through License Zero by linking a standard [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payment processing account, via [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).  Stripe Connect enables License Zero to connect its Stripe account to yours, then generate access keys to initiate payment processing requests directly on your account.  Stripe assesses its fee, and any commission for licensezero.com, on the transaction.


### <a id="identifiers">Identifiers</a>

licensezero.com generates unique identifiers for each developer and each project.  The identifiers are version 4 [UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) like:

    daf5a8b1-23e0-4a9f-a6c1-69c40c71816b


### <a id="cryptography">Cryptography</a>

When you connect a Stripe account to licensezero.com, the site creates a unique UUID for you, as well as a [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/)/[libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/) style [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/software.html) cryptographic signing keypair.  licensezero.com signs most kind of licensing information, from package metadata to `LICENSE` files, private licenses, waivers, and relicensing agreements, with the keypair created for your account, as well as its own keypair.

licensezero.com publishes the public signing key generated for you on your project pages, and via the API.  Buyers, using the [command line interface](#command-line-interface) can verify signatures on private licenses and other documents against the public key.

licensezero.com will not share the secret signing key generated for you with anyone, even with you.  But using the API, through the command line interface, you can have licensezero.com sign [waivers](#waivers) and package metadata on your behalf.


### <a id="project-pages">Project Pages</a>

licensezero.com serves a page with project information and a private license purchase form for each project.  For example:

<https://licensezero.com/projects/daf5a8b1-23e0-4a9f-a6c1-69c40c71816b>

The URL pattern is:

```text
https://licensezero.com/projects/{UUID}
```

Where `{UUID}` is the UUIDv4 for your project.


### <a id="pricing-graphics">Pricing Graphics</a>

licensezero.com serves SVG graphics with private-license pricing information that you can include in your project's `README` file or other documentation.  For example:

<figure><img alt="a pricing graphic" src="https://licensezero.com/projects/daf5a8b1-23e0-4a9f-a6c1-69c40c71816b/badge.svg"></figure>

The URL pattern is:

```text
https://licensezero.com/projects/{UUID}.svg
```

Where `{UUID}` is the UUIDv4 for your project.

The Markdown syntax is:

```markdown
![L0](https://licensezero.com/projects/{UUID}.svg)
```


## <a id="artless-devices">Artless Devices</a>

Artless Devices LLC is a California limited liability company.  It serves as the legal counterpart to those technical systems.  As a maintainer, you will have three legal relationships with Artless Devices:


### <a id="service-provider">Service Provider</a>

To use licensezero.com and its API, you must agree to [terms of service](https://licensezero.com/terms/service) with Artless Devices.  The terms were written to be read, and you should read them.  They set important rules about responsibility and liability, and make very explicit that Artless Devices isn't going to provide, or be responsible for, any legal advice about whether License Zero is right for you or your project.


### <a id="licensing-agent">Licensing Agent</a>

To offer private licenses for sale through licensezero.com, you agree to the [agency terms](https://licensezero.com/terms/agency) with Artless Devices.  You should definitely read that agreement, and again, it was written to be read, not glaze your eyes over.  But there are a few especially important aspects, from Artless Devices' point of view.

First and foremost, you appoint Artless Devices as your agent to sign license agreements, waivers, and relicense agreements on your behalf.  That means that Artless Devices can the kinds of deals you authorize through the API, through licensezero.com, with the same effect as if you'd signed them yourself.

Second, Artless Devices earns commission on private license sales.  The amount is set out in the agency terms.

Third, you guarantee that you have the rights to offer the software you offer to license through License Zero, and to keep your project's metadata in line with what the [command line interface](#command-line-interface) generates.  The guarantee helps protect Artless Devices from those trying to take license fees for others' work.  Your promise about metadata helps ensure that the [command line interface](#command-line-interface) works as intended for users buying licenses.

Fourth, the relationship isn't exclusive, and either side can end it at any time.  You can sell private licenses through other services, or on your own.

Finally, neither the terms of service nor the agency terms change ownership of any intellectual property in your projects.  You own your rights, and you keep them.  Artless Devices doesn't receive a license from you and license users.  You license users and agree to relicense projects directly.  Artless Devices merely acts as your agent, signing on your behalf, as you've directed.


### <a id="toolmaker">Toolmaker</a>

Artless Devices owns and licenses the intellectual property in the [command line interface](#command-line-interface) that you will use to register and offer licenses for sale, as well as [forms and other software tools published online](https://github.com/licensezero).


## <a id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</a>

The [command line interface](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/licensezero) is the primary maintainers and buyers interact with licensezero.com.  With [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com) installed, you can install the CLI with:

```bash
npm install --global licensezero
```


### <a id="registering">Registering</a>

The first step to offering private licenses for sale through licensezero.com is connecting a Stripe account:

```bash
licensezero register-licensor $EMAIL $NAME $JURISDICTION
```

The first item is a valid e-mail address.  The second is your legal name.  The third is the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) code for your legal jurisdiction, like `US-CA` for California, United States.

The command will open a page in your browser where you can log into Stripe or create an account, then link that account to licensezero.com.  Once you've successfully linked your account, you'll receive an identifier and an access token that you can save with:

```bash
licensezero create-licensor $UUID
```

The command will then prompt for your access token.


### <a id="offering-private-licenses">Offering Private Licenses</a>

To offer private licenses for an npm package:

```bash
cd your-npm-package
licensezero offer --solo 500 --team 10000 --company 20000 --enterprise 75000
```

Each flag corresponds to a tier of [private license](#private-licenses), with a price in United States cents.  You must set a price for each of the four tiers.

If you like, you can also set a [relicensing](#relicensing) price:

```bash
licensezero offer -s 500 -t 10000 -c 20000 -e 75000 --relicense  500000
```

You can run the `offer` subcommand at any time to update pricing.

Once you've registered the project, use the CLI to set licensing metadata and `LICENSE`:

```bash
licensezero license $UUID --noncommercial
# or
licensezero license $UUID --reciprocal
```

`$UUID` is the UUID for the project.

These commands will write a cryptographically signed `LICENSE` file, and also a `licensezero` property in `package.json` file.


### <a id="generating-waivers">Generating Waivers</a>

To generate a waiver for a project you've offered with `licensezero offer`:

```bash
licensezero waiver e91fcaa8-1d80-4d3f-97aa-5b58b93e4662 --beneficiary "SomeCo, Inc." --jurisdiction US-NY --days 30 > waiver.txt
```

You can also issue waivers that don't expire:

```bash
licensezero waiver e91fcaa8-1d80-4d3f-97aa-5b58b93e4662 -b "OtherCo, Inc." -j US-DE --days forever > waiver.txt
```

### <a id="retracting-projects">Retracting Projects</a>

You can stop offering private licenses through licensezero.com at any time:

```bash
licensezero retract $UUID
```

Please note that under the [agency terms](https://licensezero.com/terms/agency), Artless Devices can complete private license and relicensing transactions that began before you retracted the project, but can't start new transactions.


## <a id="contributions">Contributions</a>

As a independent software maintainer, you can license your work under both a [public license](#public-license) and [private licenses](#private-licenses) at the same time because you own the intellectual property in your work that others needs licenses for.  In other words, you can dual license your work because you own it.

When others contribute to your work, they will own the intellectual property in their contributions, not you.  As a result, users of your combined work will need licenses both from you and other contributors.  There are two straightforward ways to achieve that.


### <a id="parallel-licensing">Parallel Licensing</a>

You can choose to take contributions to your project only from those who license their contributions under permissive open source terms.  For example, you might license your work on a project under L0&#x2011;R, but ask contributors to license their work under [L0&#x2011;P](#permissive-license), and append the text of that license to your project's `LICENSE` file with a note that others' contributions come under that license.

Users of the combined project would then receive a license from you on the terms of L0&#x2011;R, for your contributions, and licenses from other contributors on the terms of L0&#x2011;P, for their contributions.  Would-be users who won't abide by the open source release conditions of your license can still buy a private license from you, for your contributions.  The private license for your work, plus the permissive license for others' contributions, cover all contributions.

In that kind of situation, you can sell private licenses for your contributions to the project, but others cannot.  Perhaps that feels completely fair.  If it doesn't, you may like to offer special credit, payment, or a free [waiver](#waiver) to contributors, to convince them to license their contributions under permissive terms.


### <a id="stacked-licensing">Stacked Licensing</a>

License Zero also supports projects that require multiple private licenses.  If you publish a project under L0&#x2011;R, and another developer forks the project, licensing their own work under L0&#x2011;R, too, they can append `package.json` metadata for a separate License Zero "project" in the same software.  Users who run the [command line interface](#command-line-interface) will see that they need a private license from each of you to use the project.  The same could happen with two contributors using L0&#x2011;NC, or contributors using a mix of License Zero licenses.

Note that as a maintainer, you control pricing only for your own projects, not any other maintainer's projects, even if their work builds on yours.  Developers of work you license under L0&#x2011;NC will need to purchase private licenses from you to use and build on your work for the purpose of making money through License Zero, but otherwise, License Zero doesn't say anything about any relationship between you.


## <a id="complementary-approaches">Complementary Approaches</a>

License Zero isn't the only way to financially support your work on open software, and it tries its best to remain compatible with other opportunities.

- Ask people and companies for money, and hope they give it to you.  Set up a payment link in your `README` file.  Set yourself up on [Patreon](https://patreon).  Form a foundation and solicit donations.

- Sell books, stickers, shirts, and other physical goods with your project's name or logo.

- Sell or exchange the right to put company advertising, branding, or support acknowledgments in your project's documentation, on your project's website or social media accounts, or even in your software itself.

- Give paying customers early access to your work ahead of its release as open source, some time later.

- Require others to support you financially in order to use a trademark to identify themselves as providers of related products or services.  Trademark licensing for service providers is often coupled with advertising, in the form of a listing among service providers on the project's website.

- Charge companies, conferences, or other venues to train others in the use of your project, in person or remotely.

- Charge for access to and use of your time to assist users in using your work.

- Apply to grant-making institutions and government entities for financial support, if it aligns with their objectives.

- Charge others to install, configure, and run your project on their behalf.

- Charge others to integrate your work into their applications or services.

- Charge others for work they would like to do, such as bug fixes, feature adds, and other changes.

- Sell proprietary software relating to or enhancing your open project.  For example, many open source database companies license proprietary optimizations, monitoring tools, and replication features.
